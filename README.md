### How much does it cost?

We split the bill amongst the whole group. Usually it's about $15-25 USD per person, tax and tip included.

### I have dietary needs!

[Dim sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dim_sum).js involves sharing a meal with a large group, so we try our best to accommodate you when we order/grab food off carts, and ensure you get first pick of things you can eat.

* We frequently accommodate folks who can't eat dairy, seafood, pork, or nuts.
* Most restaurants we've visited do **not** have many vegetarian/vegan-friendly dishes.
* The food at dim sum is **not** friendly to folks who are very sensitive to gluten/wheat cross-contamination, or strictly keep halal or kosher.

But you don't have to eat&mdash;join us and drink tea!

### How do I contact the organizers?

* Join the slack channel: #dimsumjs on BoroJS Slack
* Comment on or make a GitHub issue
* Reply to your ticket notification email

Please try to reach out before noon on dim sum day. Once we start eating, we're not very responsive.
